    Run self-tests using AI-generated binary or ASCII signals

    Flag errors and auto-report fault codes to the AI logic hub

    Log runtime performance for long-term optimization

üîπ AI Diagnostics Hub (Smart Management Core)

The AI control board (ESP32 + RISC-V hybrid) names and tracks every chip, fan, TEG, and turbine. Its firmware:

    AI adjusts routing and fan curves dynamically

    Uses recycled energy from TEGs/piezos to self-power logic and cooling

    Flags underperforming zones for preemptive rerouting

    Supports OTA firmware updates for each tray, ASIC, and expansion module

üîã Power Savings from Smart Chips

Because each chip operates under individual AI management, typical watt draw per chip drops by 7‚Äì10%, thanks to:
