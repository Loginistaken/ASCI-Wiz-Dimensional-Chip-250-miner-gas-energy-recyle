    Why: CNTs deliver ultra-fast, uniform heat transfer (outperforming copper), maximizing TEG efficiency
    Placement: Between each logic board and its thermal interface (PCM/TEG)
    Estimated Gain: +5–8% thermal-to-electric conversion

2. Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENG)

    What: Install TENGs to capture electricity from friction and movement (especially airflow turbulence)
    Why: Harvests mechanical energy lost as shell vibration or turbulent airflow
    Placement: Embedded between airflow ducts, under/around fan blades, and in vibration-prone shell zones
    Estimated Gain: +2–4% electricity from passive airflow

3. Photonic Bandgap Layer (Enhanced Near-IR Conversion)

    What: Add photonic bandgap materials to convert waste near-infrared radiation into usable light for photovoltaic harvesting
    Why: Captures blackbody IR radiation with higher efficiency than traditional IR films
    Placement: Between doped silicon layers and on the shell’s outer surface, paired with a high-efficiency PV overlay
    Estimated Gain: +4–6% from IR-to-light recycling

4. Magnetostrictive EM Core

    Placement: Below the PCM/TEG assemblies at the base of the stack
    Estimated Gain: +3–5% under consistent thermal cycling

6. Energy Re-Use Feedback Loop (Supercap → Fan/Logic Injection)
